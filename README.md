# ember-chain-oracle-flow

`ember-chain-oracle-flow` packages a practical blockchain tooling exercise in C. The emphasis is on deterministic behavior, a small public API, and examples that explain the tradeoffs.

## How I Read Ember Chain Oracle Flow

The useful thing to inspect here is how the same score rule is represented in code, metadata, and examples. If those three pieces disagree, the audit script should make the drift visible.

## Internal Model

The project is organized around a compact model rather than a large framework. Inputs are scored, classified, and checked against golden fixtures. The constants live in code and are mirrored in metadata so documentation drift is easy to catch. The C implementation keeps headers, source, and assertions separate so bounds and types are easy to review.

## Problem Shape

This is not a wrapper around a service. It is a self-contained project that shows how the model behaves when demand, capacity, latency, risk, and weight move in different directions.

## Main Behaviors

- Uses fixture data to keep event replay changes visible in code review.
- Includes extended examples for invariant checks, including `recovery` and `degraded`.
- Documents settlement rules tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.

## Scenario Walkthrough

`recovery` is the first example I would inspect because it lands on the `accept` path with a score of 196. The broader file also keeps `degraded` at -55 and `recovery` at 196, which gives the model a useful low-to-high spread.

## Repository Map

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Run It Locally

Use a normal shell with C available on `PATH`. The verifier is written as a PowerShell script because the portfolio was assembled on Windows.

## How To Run It

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Validation

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Known Edges

The scoring model is simple by design. More domain-specific behavior should be added through explicit adapters or extra fixture classes rather than hidden constants.

## Follow-Up Work

- Add malformed input fixtures so the failure path is as visible as the happy path.
- Split the scoring constants into a typed configuration object and validate it before use.
- Add a comparison mode that shows how decisions change when one signal is adjusted.
- Add one more blockchain tooling fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.
